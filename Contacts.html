                  <h1>Personal Profile</h1>
                  Motivated & ready-to-learn student currently attending West-MEC as my professional enviornment school and have always had a passion for coding, therefore,  it would be very nice to apply for a web developing position. Ever since i was young i've always loved tampering with computers and their systems, so when i saw there was a buisiness-like job for it i knew i had to be in the class.
